# Grunt.js

Make sure you have installed the following tools:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [Grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) (to install type: "npm install -g grunt" in your terminal)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org)

The grunt-compass task is already included as a local node module. If not, it's best to install it as a local module inside the grunt folder (npm install grunt-compass). See [grunt-compass](https://github.com/kahlil/grunt-compass) for more information.

After everything has been setup, open your terminal, navigate to the "grunt" folder and type: "grunt watch". Now whenever you make a change, grunt will lint, concatenate and minfy your files.
